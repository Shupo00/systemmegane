   We detected TypeScript in your project and reconfigured your tsconfig.json file for you. Strict-mode is set to false by default.
   The following suggested values were added to your tsconfig.json. These values can be changed to fit your 
project's needs:

        - include was updated to add '.next/types/**/*.ts'
        - plugins was updated to add { name: 'next' }
